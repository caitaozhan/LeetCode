# Write a program to solve a Sudoku puzzle by filling the empty cells.
# 
# A sudoku solution must satisfy all of the following rules:
# 
# 
# Each of the digits 1-9 must occur exactly once in each row.
# Each of the digits 1-9 must occur exactly once in each column.
# Each of the the digits 1-9 must occur exactly once in each of the 9 3x3
# sub-boxes of the grid.
# 
# 
# Empty cells are indicated by the character '.'.
# 
# 
# A sudoku puzzle...
# 
# 
# ...and its solution numbers marked in red.
# 
# Note:
# 
# 
# The given board contain only digits 1-9 and the character '.'.
# You may assume that the given Sudoku puzzle will have a single unique
# solution.
# The given board size is always 9x9.
