# Testcase Example:  '[3,2,3]'
#
# Given an integer array of size n, find all elements that appear more than âŒŠ
# n/3 âŒ‹ times.
# 
# Note: The algorithm should run in linear time and in O(1) space.
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: [3,2,3]
# Output: [3]
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: [1,1,1,3,3,2,2,2]
# Output: [1,2]

class Solution:
    '''refer to problem 169 majority element.
       first I came up with a method that add 2 minus 1, but it couldn't work out on test case [1,2,2]
       the correct way of doing it is to keep track of the larest two majority at the same time,
       then check them on a second pass
