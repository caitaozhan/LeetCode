# Testcase Example:  '2\n[2,4,1]'
#
# Say you have an array for which the i-thÂ element is the price of a given
# stock on day i.
# 
# Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete at most k
# transactions.
# 
# Note:
# You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (ie, you must
# sell the stock before you buy again).
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: [2,4,1], k = 2
# Output: 2
# Explanation: Buy on day 1 (price = 2) and sell on day 2 (price = 4), profit =
# 4-2 = 2.
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: [3,2,6,5,0,3], k = 2
# Output: 7
# Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 2) and sell on day 3 (price = 6), profit =
# 6-2 = 4.
# Then buy on day 5 (price = 0) and sell on day 6 (price = 3), profit = 3-0 =
# 3.

       need to optimize the more straight forward O(kn^2). 
       The observation is to rewrite the equation and find that there are redundancy in computation
       the equation: dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][k] + prices[j] - prices[k+1]   for -1 < k < j
       rewrite-1:    dp[i][j] = prices[j] + (dp[i-1][k] - prices[k+1]) for -1 < k < j  --> max of the ( ... )
       rewrite-2:    dp[i][j] = prices[j] + (prices[k+1] - dp[i-1][k]) for -1 < k < j  --> min of the ( ... )
       observe the above 2 rewrite, we see that 
       1. ( ... ) is independent of variable j. also i is fixed
       2. ( ... ) is bounded by j
       So, for every new j = j + 1, just keep doing max or min of the current ( ... ) and the previous max or min
